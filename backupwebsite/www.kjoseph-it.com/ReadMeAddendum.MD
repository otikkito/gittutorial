"A simple unemployed person who loves taking initiative, collaborates, likes learning, for 
propriety, equity, for formal diagnoses, and a consolidated constitution.  I 
also believe that every person should have a degree and at least one 
certification and sticks to their profession unless a sane job market determines 
otherwise. My career goal is to have a salary paying job to pay for retirement 
to qualify for social security in my older years. I also believe one should work 
for the government and private sector as well before retirement and that politics 
and laws are always changing for me in particular and as a whole."
