.TH OPENPROC 3 "20 June 2014" "Linux Manpage" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME 
openproc, closeproc  \- initialize process information from /proc/
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <proc/readproc.h>
.sp 
.BI "PROCTAB* openproc (int " flags ", ... );"
.br
.BI "void closeproc (PROCTAB* " PT ");"

.SH SYNOPSIS

The 
.B openproc
function initializes a PROCTAB structure which can be used by iterated
readproc calls to get information on current processes. Depending on
.IR flags ,
openproc may need a second argument or a second and third argument
(see below).

.B closeproc
closes all files opened by
.B openproc
and deallocates the memory allocated by 
.B openproc.
 
The PROCTAB structure is defined in 
.I <proc/readproc.h>
.ta
.fi
.RE

.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.B openproc
returns a pointer to a PROCTAB structure, or NULL if an error
occurs. This usually means that 
.I /proc 
cannot be read by the process.

.SH "FLAGS"

The behaviour of 
.B openproc
is controlled by the following set of flags, which may be ORed
together. There are three 
different kinds of flags. The first group of flags determins which
information gets read from /proc/#pid for each process. The second
group of flags (of which only one can be enacted for a opendir call)
restricts which processes information is read for by providing a list
of criteria. The third group of flags restricts this as well, but
doesn't need arguments. These may be used together again.

.TP 0.5i
.B "PROC_FILLMEM " 
read information from 
.IR /proc/#pid/statm .
.TP 0.5i
.B "PROC_FILLCOM " 
allocate 
.I cmdline
part of 
.I proc_t 
and read information from 
.IR /proc/#pid/cmdline .
.TP 0.5i
.B "PROC_FILLENV " 
allocate 
.I environ
part of 
.I proc_t 
and read information from 
.IR /proc/#pid/environ .
.TP 0.5i
.B "PROC_FILLUSR "
resolve user ids to names via
.IR /etc/passwd .
.TP 0.5i
.B "PROC_FILLGRP "
resolve group ids to names via
.IR /etc/group .
.TP 0.5i
.B "PROC_FILLSTATUS " 
read information from 
.IR  /proc/#pid/status .
.TP 0.5i
.B "PROC_FILLSTAT " 
read information from 
.IR /proc/#pid/stat .
.TP 0.5i
.B "PROC_FILLWCHAN " 
do WCHAN lookup.
.TP 0.5i
.B "PROC_FILLARG " 
equivalent to PROC_FILLCOM.
.TP 0.5i
.B "PROC_FILLSWAP " 
read the "swap" field from 
.IR /proc/#pid/smaps .
.TP 0.5i
.BR PROC_LOOSE_TASKS "
threat threads as if they were processes.
.TP 0.5i
.BR PROC_PID  " (2nd argument " pid_t *\fIpidlist\fR)
lookup only processes whose pid is contained in 
.IR pidlist .
This list must be terminated by 0.
.TP 0.5i
.BR PROC_UID " (arguments " uid_t *\fIuidlist\fB, int \fIn\fR)
lookup only processes whose user id is contained in 
.IR uidlist .
.I n
is the number of uids contained in the list 
.IR uidlist .

.SH NOTE
Only one of the flags needing additional arguments
.RB ( "PROC_{PID,UID}" )
may be used.
